    "description": "It is a sunnah to perform Sa’i immediately after Tawaf, although you may take a break if you need to. If you feel tired after Tawaf or your feet are aching, you may take a rest until you feel you’re ready. Remember, you will be covering over three kilometres during Sa’i, so make sure you have sufficient energy to complete the rite before starting.",

    "description": "· To perform Sa’i yourself.\n· To have entered into Ihram before performing the Sa’i.\n· To stay in Ihram until the Sa’i has been completed.\n· To perform Sa’i at its correct time.\n· To begin Sa’i at Safa and finish at Marwa.\n· To perform Sa’i after having done Tawaf.\n· To perform Sa’i on foot unless you have a valid excuse.\n· To perform seven laps.\n· To cover the complete distance between Safa and Marwa.\n· Istilam of the Hajar al-Aswad\n\nBefore Sa’i, it is sunnah to do Istilam of Hajar al-Aswad one last time. This will be the ninth time, following the eight times you performed Istilam during Tawaf. If you’ve forgotten to perform this Istilam, or you’re finding it difficult to return to the line of the Hajar al-Aswad due to crowding or tiredness, it may be omitted. However, you can do Istilam anywhere else in Masjid al-Haram, as long as you’re facing the Hajar al-Aswad.",

    "description": "Proceed to the hill of Safa, which is located inside Masjid al-Haram in line with the Hajar al-Aswad. There are signs which indicate where it is. As you’re approaching Safa, it is sunnah to recite the following:\n\nإِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِنْ شَعَائِرِ الله\nInna ṣ-Ṣafā wa l-Marwata min shaʿā’iri Llāh.\n\nIndeed, Safa and Marwa are from the Signs of Allah. [Surah al-Baqarah, 2:158]\n\nThen say:\n\nأَبْدَأُ بِمَا بَدَأَ اللهُ بِهِ\nAbda’u bimā badā’ Llāhu bih.\n\nI begin with that which Allah has begun with.\n\nThese should only be recited once before Sa’i and not at the start of each lap.",

    "description": "Upon reaching the hill of Safa, face the direction of the Kaaba and raise your hands in supplication. Your view of the Kaaba may be obscured, so make an educated guess about its location and face this direction. Don’t raise your hands up to your earlobes or gesture towards the Kaaba as you would have done during Tawaf. You may say Takbir (Allāhu akbar), Tahlil (lā ilāha illa Llāh) and send Salawat upon the Prophet ﷺ.\n\nIt is sunnah to recite the following du’a:\n\nاللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ ❁ اللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ ❁ اللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ ❁ وَلِلّٰهِ الْحَمْدُ ❁\nAllāhu akbar, Allāhu akbar, Allāhu akbar, wa li Llāhi l-ḥamd.\n\nAllah is the Greatest; Allah is the Greatest; Allah is the Greatest, and to Allah belongs all praise.\n\nلَآ إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ ❁ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ ❁ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ❁ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ ❁\nLa ilāha illa Llāhu waḥdahu la sharīka lah, lahu l-mulku wa lahu l-ḥamd, yuḥīī wa yumīt, wa huwa ʿalā kulli shay’in qadīr.\n\nThere is no deity except Allah, alone without a partner. To Him belongs the Dominion, and to Him belongs all praise. He gives life and death, and He has power over everything.\n\nلَآ إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ ❁ اَنْجَزَ وَعْدَهُ وَنَصَرَ عَبْدَهُ وَهَزَمَ اَلْأَحْزَابَ وَحْدَهُ ❁\nLa ilāha illa Llāhu waḥdah, anjaza waʿdahu wa naṣara ʿabdahu wa hazama l-aḥzāba waḥdah.\n\nThere is no deity except Allah alone. He fulfilled His promise, supported His slave and defeated the Confederates alone.\n\nAfter reciting this du’a, you may recite your own supplications. Read the du’a a total of three times, making your own supplications in between each time, as was the sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ.",
